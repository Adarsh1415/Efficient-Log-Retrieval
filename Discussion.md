**Approach**

**Binary Search for Start and End Positions:**

Use binary search to find the starting byte position of the first log entry for the given date.

Similarly, use binary search to find the starting byte position of the first log entry for the next day. This helps in determining the end boundary for the logs of the given date.

**Efficient File Handling:**

Read the log file in binary mode to handle large files efficiently.

Use file seeking and chunk reading to navigate through the file without loading the entire file into memory.

**Direct Byte Extraction:**

Once the start and end positions are determined, directly read the bytes between these positions and write them to the output file. This avoids processing each line individually and ensures efficient memory usage.
